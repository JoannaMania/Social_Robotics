Assume that there is a roulette wheel. You believe that there is a 90% chance that the roulette wheel is fair, a 5% chance that the roulette wheel is biased to make the ball land on red 60% of the time and a 5% chance that the wheel is biased to make the ball land on black 60% of the time. What is the probability that you observe ‘R R R R R’ as the result of spinning the wheel 5 times and the wheel is biased towards red?; First calculate the probability of the sequence given that the wheel is biased towards red. Then take the prior belief of the wheel being biased towards red into consideration.;0.0039
Suppose a team at Facebook decides to develop a method for guessing which of its users are likely to be involved in terrorism against the US. Let’s assume that there are 200 million Facebook users in the US, of which 10,000 are future terrorists. How likely is an average user to be a terrorist?; You need to divide something by the total number of Facebook users; 1 over 20000
This exercise is built on the previous one. Given that Facebook’s algorithm flags 100,000 users as potential terrorists and that the flagged users are twice as likely as the average user to be terrorists, how likely is a flagged user to be a terrorist?; Use your answer to the previous problem.; 1 over 10000
This question builds on the Facebook problem. How many flagged people are terrorists?; Consider your answer to the previous question and the number of flagged users.;10
