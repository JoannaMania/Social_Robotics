Name of the project:

Date:
September - December 2020

Joanna Mania, Nele Alberts, Masha Tsfasman

Background information:
Chatbots, embodied and conversational virtual agents, and social robots are becoming part of our everyday life. In this context, more and more attention is being given to verbal and nonverbal behavioral characteristics, like speech, intonation, gaze and gestures that humans show when communicating with both other people and machines. This behavior is then related to different dialogue functions, including turn-taking, addressing others, and backchanneling, that give shape to the communication process.


Goal of the project: 
This project presents a development of a socially aware conversational agent taking a role of a math tutor that accommodates its behaviour to the performance and mood of the student. Taking into account the sensitive nature of the application, we strove to create a highly explainable and predictable system that allows high level of control over the interaction to prevent from undesired and hurtful actions towards the users.

Course:
